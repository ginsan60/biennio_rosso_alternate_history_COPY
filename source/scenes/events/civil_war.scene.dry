= The Array of Forces

Our enemies are the paramilitary Arditismo, with [+ ard_strength +] thousand troops, the Far-right Fasci, with [+ fdc_strength +] thousand troops and the Anti-Bolshevik Leagues, with [+ abl_strength +] thousand troops. The loyalties of the Regio Esercito, with its [+ army_strength +] thousand regular soldiers, and Carabinieri, with [+ interior_police_strength +] thousand members, are unclear. [? if pcdi_formed : It is unclear whether we can count on the radical forces of the Red Guards to aid us. ?]

On our side, we have the Red Guards, at [+ rg_strength +] thousand members. [? if dissent > 0.15 and dissent <= 0.25: It is somewhat weakened by dissent within the party, and some members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent > 0.25 and dissent < 0.5: It is weakened by dissent within the party, and many members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent >= 0.5: It is heavily weakened by dissent within the party, and a substantial portion of members choose not to fight. ?]

[? if rg_militancy < 0.25 : Unfortunately, the Red Guards are poorly trained and equipped, and will not be able to stand against our more militarised opponents. ?][? if rg_militancy >= 0.25 and rg_militancy < 0.5 : We have spent some resources training and equipping the Red Guard. Let us hope our people can persist. ?][? if rg_militancy >= 0.5 : We have spent quite a great deal of resources on turning the Guard into a fighting force. Let us hope that they survive. ?]

What else do we have?

General strikes are a significant tool we have against both the bourgeois and the far-right, and it can help us out now.

@defeat
achievement: follia_di_sinistra

= Total Defeat

Our forces are no match for those of the reactionaries. Red Guard forces are quickly overpowered by the forces of the Arditismo, Fasci, and Regio Esercito. Many are killed before the rest surrender. Our remaining leaders flee the country or face execution, as the reactionaries take absolute power over Italy.

Our resistance will be recorded in the history books, and in the future, our names will be honored. But for now, all is lost.

- @game_over: Game over.

@long_war
achievement: guerra_civile

= Long War

The initial phase of the action ends, and somehow, both sides remain standing.

The war settles into fixed battle lines. This will not be a quick coup, but a long civil war. The nation will destroy itself before it can be rebuilt again.

- @game_over: Game over.

achievement: vittoria_monarchica

= Victory for the Kingdom

The battle lines hold, and the Fasci, Arditismo, and pro-coup Regio Esercito forces are defeated. Today, the forces of the kingdom prevail over the fascists. It will be tough to recover once more before we have even recovered from our involvement in the First World War, but we are confident.

Italy holds strong, against fascism.

achievement: vittoria_sovietica

= Victory for the Socialists

The bourgeois and fascists lines shatter, as their forces are quickly overwhelmed by pro-socialist forces and the Red Guard, forcing a surrender. The Monarchy has been abolished, as bourgeois leaders are arrested and trialed in people's courts across the nation. The 18th Congress has been scheduled to occur within a few months to determine the state and organisation of the new nation.

Italy has toppled its bourgeois oppressors and established a revolutionary state.

- @post_war_force: It is time to decide the new agenda.

@post_war_cv

- @none: We have done all we can for the moment.

@pressure_ban

go-to: post_war_cv

We are able to pressure the King, as well as convince the other parties to outlaw the [+ pnf_name +] for this attempted March on Rome.

@none
on-arrival: nationalist_sentiment -= 9; republican_sentiment += 7

Regardless, the failure of the March on Rome has bolstered republican opposition within the country, who view the March as the result of the King's incompetence and inability to lead this nation in crisis.

Similarly, nationalist sentiments within the country have been besmirched by this failed coup attempt.
