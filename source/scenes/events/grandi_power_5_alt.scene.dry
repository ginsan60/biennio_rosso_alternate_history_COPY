= Introduction of the Acerbo Law

The Acerbo Law, an amendment to electoral law, has reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, introduced by Giacomo Acerbo, one of the PNF's Deputies. The change in law would result in which gained at least 25 per cent of the votes â€“ gained two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The remaining third was to be shared amongst the other parties proportionally.

This is an obvious power grab by [+ pnf_leader +], who seeks to consolidate power, and we must oppose this bill, considering the rampant violence and voter intimidation we have seen throughout the country. We can contact the other parties, and hopefully get them to recognise this bill for what it is and vote it down.

What should we do?

[? if psi_unreliable : Unfortunately, our forces are being harassed consistently by the far-right paramilitaries, who are able to overwhelm our forces. We will be able to rely on half of our own deputies voting against the Law, optimistically. ?]
