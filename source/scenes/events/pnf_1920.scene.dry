= 1920 [+ pnf_full_name +] Congress

The *Fasci Italiani di Combattimento*, known also as the Fasci was formed in March and have begun their second congress to decide the party's agenda. [? if not mussolini_jailed :It seems all but confirmed that Benito Mussolini will come out on top once again. ?][? if mussolini_jailed: With Mussolini in jail, the organisation's future is uncertain. ?]

Unsurprisingly, Mussolini has triumphed once more. The organisation has however, surprisingly turned from left-wing politics, instead exalting the existing institutions, seemingly becoming a new reactionary force in response to us. In response, the left-wing of the party, made up of some futurists and syndicalists, have left the party, seeking refuge as independents or in other parties.

- @root: Opportunists.

on-arrival: pnf_leader = "Grand Council"; veterans_pnf -= 5;

With Mussolini absent, the Grand Council of Fascism, comprised of Cesare Forni, Dino Grandi, Emilio De Bono, Italo Balbo and prominent members of the Fasci have formed to control the organisation, with Mussolini *de jure* operating in absentia.

Regardless, the lack of leadership seems to have weakened the organisation, even if only slightly.
