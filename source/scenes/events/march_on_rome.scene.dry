@cv_menu

We are at a crossroads. The results of Bologna has resulted in us taking a middle-of-the-line avenue, advocating for both extraparliamentary means and participation in government, at least without the bourgeois parties. The communists on the left, however, argue that this is the perfect opportunity to strike, while the reformists on the left argue for our continued participation in government.

What should we do?

- @cv_fight: The Communists should be heeded; we must use this opportunity!
- @cv_def: The Reformists should be heeded; we should continue our position in government.

Whatever the case, our initial force has been defeated and forced to retreat, as [+ pnf_leader +] threatens further violence to bring 'order' to the Kingdom. Violence and blood is painted on the streets of Rome, as men across Italy are ordered to take up arms, either in defence of the Kingdom against fascism or socialism.

It seems the March on Rome has erupted into chaos, as forces across the nation take up arms, pledging support to one side or the other.

We are able to pressure the King, as well as convince the other parties to outlaw the [+ pnf_name +] for this attempted March on Rome.

@none
on-arrival: nationalist_sentiment -= 9; republican_sentiment += 7

Regardless, the failure of the March on Rome has bolstered republican opposition within the country, who view the March as the result of the King's incompetence and inability to lead this nation in crisis.

Similarly, nationalist sentiments within the country have been besmirched by this failed coup attempt.
