= Streetfighting

Frequently, and more often than not, our forces — whether that is the Red Guards or merely workers intending to defend themselves — face off against far-right paramilitaries. Whether that is the Anti-Bolshevik Leagues, funded by their elite backers, the Arditismo, former members of the *Arditi* special forces radicalised or even the Fasci themselves, determined to eliminate us. 

- @engage_fdc: Engage our forces with the Fasci.
- @engage_ard: Engage our forces with the Arditismo.
- @engage_abl: Engage our forces with the Anti-Bolshevik Leagues.

Our forces are, thankfully, able to come out victorious against our opponents. Our forces have been damaged, but the forces of the far-right are hurt significantly more.

Our forces are, unfortunately, unable to come out victorious, forced to retreat. Our forces have been significantly damaged, though so have theirs at a lesser capacity.
