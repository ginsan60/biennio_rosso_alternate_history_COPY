Currently, the PNF is in power only via an Emergency Government as authorised by King Vittorio Emanuele III following the ousting of Gabriele D'Annunzio. However, the King has recently announced his intention to revoke his decree, forcing the PNF to begin forming coalitions once more.

Though D'Annunzio's economic policies had alienated the conservative right, Grandi's pivot back towards the right has warmed the party back up with the Conservatives, and though some skeptical, it is likely at least some of the parties are willing to coalition with the PNF. It is unclear whether it will be enough to form a majority government once more, but being unable to do so will significantly harm Grandi's influence and control as Prime Minister.

The Fascists are, thankfully, unable to form a majority coalition with the other parties. Unfortunately, Grandi is able to convince the King to allow the Emergency Government to continue at the very least until new elections in which a new government majority can be formed.

Shockingly, the PNF is able to reconcile with the other conservative parties, allowing it to form a stable majority coalition and the revocation of the King's emergency government, granting Grandi's government significant legitimacy in the eyes of the people.
