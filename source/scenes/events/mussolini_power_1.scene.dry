= Formation of the Voluntary Militia for National Security

The *Squadrismo*, paramilitary wing of the [+ pnf_full_name +], has been reorganised into the MVSN, or *Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale*, integrating the organisation into the Regio Esercito under [+ pnf_leader +]'s orders. 

This has given a significant boost to the strength of the paramilitary, as well as given it access to a larger range of weaponry that can begin using against us.
