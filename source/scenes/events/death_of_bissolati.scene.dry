= The Death of Leonida Bissolati

@pm

Prime Minister Leonida Bissolati has died while in office. He will be greatly missed. But now, we must select a new Prime Minister.

The PSRI are heavily pushing for us to support Bonomi, Bissolati's successor, as Prime Minister. However, we can support our own candidates, or others.

- @turati_pm: Filippo Turati ([+ psi_name +]) for Prime Minister.
- @bonomi_pm: Ivanoe Bonomi (PSRI) for Prime Minister.
- @de_gasperi_pm: Let Alcide De Gasperi of the Catholic Party become Prime Minister.
- @orlando_pm: Let Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of the Liberal Democrats become Prime Minister.

Our coalition partners on the right are reluctant to accept the new Prime Minister, but they do not make loud objections. The PSRI thanks us for our backing, and we see an improvement in relations.

@not_pm

Leonida Bissolati, right-reformist and leader of the Italian Reformist Socialist Party has passed away. His death represents the weakening of social democracy in the party, and he is succeeded by Ivanoe Bonomi.

He will be missed.
