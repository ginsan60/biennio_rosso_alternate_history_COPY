= Collapse of the National Bloc

[? if giolitti_betrayed = 1 : [+ ul_leader +] has fallen as Prime Minister, betrayed by [+ pnf_leader +] and his National Fascist Party during the Vote-of-No-Confidence. As such, the anti-socialist National Bloc has been dissolved. ?]

[? if not giolitti_betrayed = 1 : Owing to recent political developments, the National Bloc has collapsed into infighting, as the National Fascist Party and the Social Democrats have both left the Liberal anti-socialist Bloc. ?]

- @root: Good riddance.
