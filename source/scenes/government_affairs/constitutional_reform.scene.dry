# cosmetic stuff for now, except the veto thing

= Constitutional Reform

The Statuto Albertino, the constitution of the current Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Sardinia preceding it, has often been changed to keep up with modern times. The 1919 amendment to give all men the right to vote and alter the electoral system to a proportional representation system are the most recent examples.

Now that we control a sizeable bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, we are able to alter the Statuto Albertino as well. We will need an absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies as well as the approval of the Senate and the King to pass any reforms. 

@reforms_menu

- @article_33: Alter Article 33.
- @article_65: Alter Article 65.

@article_33

The Constitutional Amendment makes it to the King, who is convinced to approve the measure, limiting the powers of the Senate and further democratising the Kingdom.

@article_65
subtitle: Make the Prime Minister choose and appoint his own ministers.

The reform passes with the slightest of margins, removing the Statuto Albertino as the constitution of the Kingdom of Italy. A new constitutional congress is to be held in the coming weeks as the King officially abdicates the throne.

- @post_war_peaceful: It is time to decide our new agenda.
