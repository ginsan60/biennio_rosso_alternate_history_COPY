= Child Labour

Child Labour is rampant throughout Italy, especially the Southern regions. The previous governments have done some work to attempt to curb this issue, from the Casati Law to the Coppino Act to safety laws, these have done relatively little to mitigate the issue. Now that we are in power, however, we can act decisively to finally fix this system.

# another 'situation' esque thing - like the southern question 
# labour, public education ministries for the two

- @child_safety: Develop and enforce safety regulation.
- @education_attendance: Enforce and pass compulsory education laws.
- @child_welfare: Improve welfare for poor families with children.
- @child_ban: Attempt to raise the minimum working age to 16.
- @return: Do not enact any policies for now.

The Labour Ministry works on developing and enforcing safety regulations, in order to ensure healthy working conditions for children in the workforce. [? if child_safety >= 3 : Businesses have begun to argue that our focus on safety, even for children, is overbearing and unnecessary, interfering with the economy. ?]

We continue enforcing the *Casati Law* further, as well as amending it further to increase the percentages necessary to qualify as 'adequate', improving attendance overall.

We have increased welfare spending on poorer families with children. [? if child_welfare >= 3 and unemployment >= 15 : Some of our coalition partners consider increased welfare spending profligate at this time. ?]

Unfortunately, our proposal is voted down in the Chamber of Deputies, with the [+ pnf_name +]'s and [+ ldr_name +] speaking in particularly vehement opposition. The activists, feeling demoralized from this attempt, have decided to bide their time.

With the support of the left including the PSRI[? if pri_prominent: and the PRI?], we have successfully passed a bill to ban child labour in Italy! This has heartened our more radical supporters, while hurting our relations with the [+ ldr_name +]. With the increasing political discourse around child labour, the [+ ldr_name +] and DS have gained landowner and industrialist votes at the expense of the [+ pnf_name +].

[? if child_welfare < 3 : Unfortunately, the bill has seemingly backfired, as the new ban on child labour has forced many into further poverty due to a lowered income. ?]
