We have already formulated an economic plan. Now we have to implement it. [? if not left_wing_coalition and not psi_majority :Unfortunately, our coalition partners will resist us every step of the way. ?]

We begin forcefully seizing idle industries, nationalising vast sums of the economy without compensating the greedy industrialists a single cent. They are, of course, outraged, and utilise their backings and support from the liberal parties. The [+ pnf_name +] use this as propaganda, fearmongering to the middle class and other industrialists who are swayed to support them.
