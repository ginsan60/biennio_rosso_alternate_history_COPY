= Revolution or Reform?

Our party is wracked as to how to deal with the bourgeois and the monarchy. The Left-wing Maximalists advocate for direct, revolutionary action, seeking to overthrow the autocratic Monarchy utilising the paramilitaries and with popular support. On the other hand, the Reformists advocate for governmental participation in government, seeking to advocate and reform the political system within parliamentary means, while the Maximalists, caught in the middle, advocate for Centre Marxism, situating themselves between the revolutionary rhetoric of the Left-wing of the party and the reformist alignment of the Right-wing of the party.

- @support_reformists: Sway sympathetic members towards reformism.
- @support_revolutionaries: Sway sympathetic members towards revolutionary ideals.

We are able to sway some of the more right-wing members of the party to our cause, advocating for a more reformist approach. This only further exacerbates the split within the party, however.

We are able to sway some of the more left-wing members of the party to our cause, advocating for a more revolutionary approach. This only further exacerbates the split within the party, however.

@support_none

Let's keep the party as it is for now.
