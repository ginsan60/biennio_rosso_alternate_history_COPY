= Choosing our enemies

In our media and campaign materials, who should we consider as our main opponents?

[? if enemies != 0 : Previously, we had considered the [+ enemies +] as our prior enemies. Is a change of direction necessary? ?]

- @anti_dem: The anti-democratic parties of the far right and left - the PCd'I, and the PNF.
- @communists: The PCd'I alone.
- @pnf: The [+ pnf_name +] alone.
- @religious: The Religious parties - the PPI.
- @bourgeois: The Bourgeois parties - the [+ ldr_name +] and [+ ul_name +].
- @easy_discard
- @cancel_advisor_action

@anti_dem
view-if: pcdi_formed
on-arrival: enemies = "anti-democratic parties"; maximalist_strength += 5; reformist_strength += 5; communist_dissent += 5; workers_pcdi -= 2; workers_pnf -= 2; radicalisation -= 0.05;

Attacking the far right and left is popular among all but the left wing of our party, who would prefer to be fighting the bourgeois parties.

@communists
view-if: pcdi_formed
on-arrival: enemies = "PCd'I"; reformist_strength += 5; communist_dissent += 8; reformist_dissent -= 5; pcdi_relation -= 15; ldr_relation += 3; ul_relation += 5; ppi_relation += 5; workers_pcdi -= 4; radicalisation -= 0.05;

Attacking the PCd'I is supported by all but the most left-wing socialists, and wins us some measure of approval among the bourgeois parties. However, If we are to reconcile with the communists, this may not be the best choice.

@pnf
on-arrival: enemies = pnf_name; fasci_urgency += 1; workers_pnf -= 4; nationalist_sentiment -= 3*(1-dissent); workers_pnf += 4 if pnf_votes < 2; veterans_pnf += 8 if pnf_votes < 2

[? if fasci_urgency == 0 or pnf_seating_disp < 10 : The [+ pnf_name +] is a tiny party right now, with more bark than bite. Many in our party are questioning our choices. ?][? if (fasci_urgency > 0 and pnf_seating_disp >= 10) or prime_minister_party == pnf_name : The fascists are the most urgent problem for us to deal with. ?][? if pnf_votes < 2 and not pnf_in_government : Worse, giving them attention while they're such a small party only attracts attention to them. ?]

@religious
on-arrival: enemies = "religious parties"; communist_strength += 5; reformist_dissent += 8; communist_dissent -= 5; ppi_relation -= 15; workers_ppi -= 4; republican_sentiment -= 4; coalition_dissent += 1 if socialist_catholic_coalition

Attacking the PPI certainly aligns with our secular ideals, and wins us some measure of approval among the left. However, it may make it harder to build the coalitions that are necessary for government in the future.

@bourgeois
on-arrival: enemies = "bourgeois parties"; left_strength += 8; left_dissent -= 5; ldr_relation -= 5; ul_relation -= 5; reformist_dissent += 8; workers_ldr -= 3; coalition_dissent += 1 if centre_left_coalition; republican_sentiment -= 3

Our anti-bourgeois rhetoric is popular among the left, but may make it harder to build the coalitions that are necessary for government in the future.
