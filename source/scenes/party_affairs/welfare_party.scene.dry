= Dealing with Veterans' Welfare

Following our defeat at Caporetto and the subsequent formation of the *Opera Nazionale Combattenti*, the previous liberal government promised soldiers welfare as high as the moon to re-moralise them, and now it is up to us to actually take care of our veterans and fufill these promises. 

What do we do?

# most of these will need to have a ministry involved as well; except the third one
# place in party deck as well?

- @veterans_organisations_party: Increase the funding of our own welfare organisations.
- @root: Our resources limits our ability to improve welfare.

We begin distributing funds to the *Opera Nazionale Combattenti*, and the funds are reallocated to aid veterans immediately.
